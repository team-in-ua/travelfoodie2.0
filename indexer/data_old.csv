"A fun, delicious, and spicy cuisine: Mexican! As one of the world's most popular types of cuisine, Mexican food is full of flavour and colour. The cuisine blends ancient Aztec ingredients with Spanish flavours to create unique dishes sure to tantalise your taste buds.Some of the most famous Mexican dishes include tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and guacamole. Mexican cuisine offers a wide variety of options for anyone looking to try something new and exciting - especially with how customisable these dishes can be. Mexican cuisine is probably one of the more familiar types of foreign cuisine in America today. You can thank Taco Bell and other chains for that. However, Taco Bell and others are rarely authentic Mexican food experiences. In fact, Taco Bell famously failed when they tried expanding to Mexico!Indigenous and colonial factors are the main contributors to authentic Mexican cuisine. You'll see plenty of dishes that use common local ingredients such as maize (corn), avocados, and so on.Unlike the varieties you see in Taco Bell and elsewhere, authentic tacos are always soft. Wheat or corn flour are the main ingredients of authentic Mexican tacos. Flour tacos are more common in Northern Mexico, while corn tacos are ubiquitous in the southern regions. Unlike American tacos which primarily use ground beef, Mexican tacos use a wider variety of fillings. Fish tacos even exist! Finally, Mexican tacos usually have their ingredients served as toppings rather than being wrapped.Mexican cuisine has too many delicacies to list here. But suffice to say, other popular Mexican dishes include chilaquiles (a tortilla-based dish often eaten at breakfast), huevos rancheros (ranch eggs), menudo (pork and corn stew), and of course burritos.",Mexico
"Nothing quite matches Indian cuisine. The flavours and ingredients used vary greatly from region to region, from northern India to south. Chicken tikka masala is one of the most popular Indian dishes in the world, with a mixture of tender chicken and creamy tomato sauce. Other popular dishes include samosas, naan bread, biryani rice, and chana masala. You also can't forget the popular chai - easily found at most coffee shops these days. Another type of cuisine that probably deserves a list of its own, Indian cuisine is as diverse as you'd expect from a country of over 1 billion people. Given that the majority of Indians are Hindus, it's not surprising that Indian cuisine is heavy on veggies. It also has nods to Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, and even colonial influence. Curry is perhaps the most iconic Indian dish. It's so popular that other non-Indian nations such as Britain and Japan have their takes on it. However, authentic Indian curry is made with ground spices called garam masala. Some local variants also use curry leaves. Given that many Hindus are vegetarian, Indian curry usually does not contain any meat. India's cuisine is so diverse that we would be here all day if we listed everything! However, some internationally popular Indian dishes include Aloo gobi (a cauliflower and potato mix), naan (a kind of flatbread), paneer (Indian cheese), and biryani (a rice dish that's also popular in other parts of Asia). Unsurprisingly, Indian cuisine has influenced its neighbors and every place where the Indian diaspora is present.",India
"When it comes to comfort food, Italian dishes reign supreme. Filled with tomato-based sauces, creamy cheese, and pastas galore, it's no wonder why so many people love this cuisine! The array of Italian dishes such as lasagna, cannelloni, pizza Margherita, spaghetti bolognese and risotto are truly incredible and offer a world of flavour. Perfectly balancing intense flavours with fresh ingredients, each dish is a culinary masterpiece that has been perfected over centuries. Traditional authentic Italian pizzas are flat and baked in wood-fired ovens. These pizzas can either have tomato sauce toppings or only have olive oil seasonings. Unlike many exported pizzas, Italian pizzas are light on meat, instead mostly having vegetable topics. One thing that remains the same? Cheese. Lots and lots of it. Usually mozzarella, but other varieties are also common. There are perhaps as many varieties of Italian pasta as there are Italian cities. Whether it's spaghetti, fettuccini, alfredo, lasagna, and so on, there's definitely pasta for everyone. Even the sauces vary, ranging from Bolognese to carbonara, and everything in between. Italy isn't just all pasta and pizza, however. There's also risotto, a rice dish. Gnocchi are potato dough balls. Pesto, the ever-popular sauce, can be enjoyed on its own or used in pasta and pizza. And of course, there's gelato, Italian-style ice cream that has gained a cult following worldwide.",Italy
"While pizza, cheeseburgers, and hot dogs are some of the most iconic staples of American cuisine, there's also Louisiana seafood, a totally unmatched culinary experience! Don't forget the iconic apple pie - a quintessential American dessert. merican cuisine is so diverse that it is worth a full list of its own. Whether it's Southern food, West Coast delicacies, East Coast favorites, and everywhere in between, there's definitely something for everyone. American cuisine has many beloved favorites. One such delicacy is apple pie. Notably, the apple pie is part of the famous saying “as American as apple pie”. Ironically, apple pies may not be so American after all. Apples actually originally came from what is today Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, historians believe that Europeans were already making apple pies long before apple pies became an American staple. Other American favorites include hamburgers, fried chicken, and hot dogs. These dishes are mostly not American creations. This does actually perfectly show one interesting aspect of American cuisine. People often say that America is a melting pot of people and cultures. Thus, it's no wonder that even American cuisine is a reflection of its diverse history.",America
"And now for a trip to the Far East. Japanese cuisine is one of the world's most popular and beloved cuisines. With a focus on freshness, simplicity, and balance, Japanese dishes offer an exciting and flavourful experience. Popular Japanese dishes include not just the ever-so-popular sushi but also ramen, tempura, tonkatsu, miso soup, and teriyaki. Japanese cuisine is truly a unique culinary experience, offering an array of flavours and textures that are complex and harmoniously balanced, giving everyone something to enjoy! One of the most popular types of cuisine on this list, Japanese cuisine has many influences. Japan‘s strong fishing culture is one of them; hence the prominence of seafood. However, foreign influences have also made their imprint on Japanese cuisine. For example, ramen, one of Japan's most popular soups, actually descends from Chinese soups. Meanwhile, tempura, the famous method of battering and frying shrimp and vegetables, is a Portuguese borrowing. Nevertheless, some Japanese dishes are uniquely Japanese. Perhaps none is as famous as sushi. Resourceful Japanese people originally invented sushi as a way to preserve fish. They accomplished this by covering fish in rice and vinegar. Eventually, this became its own dish. There are many kinds of sushi. This includes makizushi (or simply maki) which involves rolling ingredients inside nori (seaweed strips). Other kinds include putting sashimi (raw meat or fish) on top of rice. Japanese cuisine is worth a deeper look as each region and prefecture has its own local specialties. We'd be here all day if we were to list every Japanese delicacy and regional fare. Popular local fare includes teriyaki (Japanese sweet barbecue), gyudon (beef bowls), karaage (fried chicken), and takoyaki (octopus meatballs).",Japan
"Out of all the types of cuisine in the world, Thai cuisine is probably one of the most exciting. This cuisine is well-renowned for balancing the five fundamental flavours: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and spicy. Dishes are often flavoured with herbs like lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, coriander and chillies for added flavour and kick. Popular dishes include pad thai noodles, tom Kha soup, green curry, and mango sticky rice. Each of these dishes takes conventional flavours and turns them around, making for an unforgettable meal. Thai cuisine has found followings far and wide. Local ingredients and sensibilities combine to make one of the most unique types of cuisine in the world. Pad Thai is Thailand‘s national dish. It's made with rice and noodles and mixed with vegetables and other ingredients. It's most commonly served as street food, but it's also served at home or in restaurants. No Thai restaurant is complete without pad thai. Mango sticky rice is another local favorite. It's a dish consisting of sticky rice and mango slices and is commonly eaten for dessert. While it is possible to eat it with utensils, it's traditionally eaten by hand. Other popular Thai treats include guay teow (Thai noodle soups), som tam (papaya salad), and khao pad (Thai fried rice).",Thailand
"Let's take a journey to France and discover the renowned French cuisine - most popular for its rich cheeses and aromatic sauces. Experience sheer indulgence with every bite as you delve into the exquisite culinary delights of this remarkable country. Classic dishes like ratatouille, bouillabaisse, onion soup and steak tartare are most often associated with French cuisine. Of course, no French meal would be complete without a decadent dessert like crème brûlée or an assortment of gorgeous and sweet pastries and macarons. Baguettes! Escargot! Champagne! Macarons! Cheese! When one thinks of France, fine dining and romance are probably what come to mind when it comes to food. But really, French people don't always eat just these. They're regular people too, eating food influenced by both local and international factors. Baguettes themselves are surprisingly young. In fact, the earliest known mention of the baguettes we know today only dates back to 1920. However, French bread has a long history, dating back to long before even the invention of baguettes. Many French delicacies are famous both locally and abroad. One example is the Soupe à l'oignon (onion soup). It's made of onions and animal stock, which is then topped with cheese. Many places in France have their take on this classic dish. French cuisine is really such an interesting topic that we would probably be here all day talking about it. It's really worth a list of its own. However, for now, let's end this blurb with perhaps the most notorious French dish of them all: escargot. Contrary to popular belief, French people do not eat buttered snails every day. In fact, most French people have never tried it even once in their lives! Indeed, most French consider escargot a special delicacy, most commonly consumed on special occasions. While traditionally it was mainly the upper classes who consumed it, today people of all backgrounds can enjoy it.",France
"Like most types of Latin American cuisine, Argentine cuisine is a fusion of native and colonial influences. You may find a lot of food that has Spanish-sounding names but aren't Spanish in origin at all. Asado is perhaps the highlight of Argentine cuisine. It's not actually a single dish but rather the term for grilling. Argentines love grilling different kinds of meat, including the usual pork and beef. In some parts of Argentina, people even roast whole pigs and sheep! Chimichurri is one of Argentina‘s other famous dishes (or perhaps more accurately condiments). It is a greenish sauce that's primarily made from chopped parsley and garnished with ginger, wine, and olive oil. While it is a South American creation, it also has an international following.",Argentina
"When one thinks of Australian cuisine, people often tend to think of two things: barbies and Vegemite. Indeed, Australians love their barbecues and Vegemite. However, Australian cuisine is much more than that.
Of course, barbecuing meat is one of the most iconic activities in Australian culture. It's one way for family and friends to get together. Meanwhile, Vegemite, Australia's unique spread, is actually a yeast product. Resourceful people created it from byproducts of beer production. It has an admittedly acquired taste but supposedly tastes better when mixed with butter and put on bread. Other famous Australian foods include meat pies, fairy bread (bread with margarine and small candies), and the ever-popular Tim Tam chocolate biscuits. Interestingly enough, despite kangaroos being an iconic Australian symbol, Australians rarely ever consume kangaroo meat.",Australia
"Austria's cuisine is quite similar to the types of cuisine of its neighbors. You've got the usual cakes and desserts, as well as sausages. Indeed, there's a kind of sausage named after Austria's capital, the Vienna sausage. One of Austria's most cherished dishes is the Apfelstrudel. It's a flat pie made with apples, sugar, cinnamon, and other flavorings. Cooks serve it in restaurants or food stalls. While Germans also love the dish, it is the Austrians who have made it a national icon. Another beloved Austrian dish is the Wiener Schnitzel. It's a deep-fried cutlet made from veal (the meat of young cattle) that is breaded and often served with potatoes.",Austria
"Believe it or not, Belgium is not all about Belgian waffles and Belgian chocolates. In fact, Belgian cuisine has a rich history that's as diverse as the people of Belgium itself. Belgium's French and Dutch-speaking populations have both inspired French cuisine, and so has the country's geography and culture. One of Belgium's most famous dishes is what we usually call French fries. Despite their name, historians believe that Belgium, not France, invented French fries! Unsurprisingly, fries are quite popular in Belgium, with many restaurants having their take on them. Given Belgium's fishing heritage, it's unsurprising that seafood makes up much of Belgian cuisine. Sea fare such as mussels, fish, and shrimp are a common sight on household dinner tables. Of course, no discussion about Belgian cuisine would be complete without Belgian waffles. Also known as Brussels waffles, these have large and deep squares. They come in both sweet and non-sweet varieties. Cooks put sugar, cream, strawberries, chocolates, and other garnishing on top for extra flavor.",Belgium
"t's no surprise that a multi-ethnic country like Bosnia and Herzegovina also has many types of cuisine. Islamic and Christian values, along with the Mediterranean and Ottoman characteristics, are the main inspirations for Bosnian cuisine. Bosniaks, who are predominantly Muslim, do not consume pork and thus they primarily consume beef and lamb dishes. On the other hand, the ethnic Serbs and Croats, who are predominantly Christian, can consume pork. Cevapi is one of the most commonly consumed dishes in the country. It's a type of kebab that's made with pita bread made with either lamb or beef. Locals and tourists chow down on cevapi in restaurants, or more commonly, at food stalls. Another popular Bosnian dish is the burek. It's a pie that's filled with meat, vegetables, or other ingredients. An Ottoman dish is its progenitor. Locals and tourists primarily consume it at food stalls.",Bosnia
"Brazilian cuisine is a melting pot of the country's multiethnic and multicultural history. You've got your native influences, Portuguese characteristics, borrowings from neighboring countries, and even nods to the country's immigrant population. Yes, Brazilian cuisine takes inspiration from many different types of cuisine. Much like its neighbor and sometimes rival, barbecues are an important aspect of Brazilian cuisine. Churrasco is the local term for barbecues, which largely come in the form of grilled meat. Cooks then season the meat with salt then cook it over either wood or charcoal. One popular Brazilian dish is feijoada. A common staple in many Portuguese-speaking countries, the Brazilian version uses black beans mixed with meat and/or sausages.",Brazil
"Much like other types of Latin American cuisine, Chile's cuisine is a fusion of indigenous flavors and colonial influences. Local geography and climate have also made their mark on Chilean cuisine. Chilean includes local twists on international fare. For example, Chileans use avocados to garnish their hotdogs (or completos)! Another popular treat in Chile is the empanada. While empanadas are common in countries with Spanish influence, Chile's take is noticeably large and often square-shaped. Cooks either fry them or bake them in wood ovens. Chilean empanadas usually have meat fillings, much like most of the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, there's the churrasco. It's a kind of meat sandwich that uses Chilean grilled steak as its filling. It also has many varieties including a lo pobre (egg sandwiches) and Italiano (avocado and tomato fillings).",Chile
"Chinese cuisine is probably one of the more familiar types of Asian cuisine on this list. Like American cuisine, Chinese cuisine probably deserves a list of its own. Not surprising considering China is a country of over 1 billion people! While there are too many Chinese delicacies to mention in this list, we will list some of the most famous examples here. Firstly, no Chinese meal is complete without rice. Rice is not just China's main staple food. It is also the basis for many types of food in China. These include rice cakes, noodles, and so on. Speaking of noodles, they are also a staple of Chinese cuisine. Noodles have a special place in Chinese culture. People young and old often eat them during New Year and birthdays as a symbol of long life. Finally, there's the Peking duck. The Peking duck is not an everyday food in China. In fact, it is considered a delicacy. Made from roast duck, cooks slice the meat, while customers put the slices inside small pieces of flat bread.",China
"Colombian cuisine is one of the most diverse types of Latin American cuisine out there. Like most of its neighbors, native and colonial flavors come together to create a unique type of cuisine. For example, one of the most common examples of Colombian food is arepas, a cornmeal-based bread. Colombians either eat it alone or made sandwiches out of it. One local delicacy associated with the city of Cali is Aborrajado. Cooks fill bananas with cheese and fry the mixture. It is quite popular among tourists. Ajico, a chicken, potato, and corn soup, is another popular delicacy, particularly in the capital Bogota. Finally, there are obleas, which are essentially oversized communication wafers. It is a favorite among many Colombians and other neighboring people. They often spread caramel on top or make sandwiches with fruits and cream.",Colombia
"Similar to other types of Middle Eastern cuisine, Egyptian cuisine is a result of religious, geographic, and resource considerations. Legumes and vegetables are particularly popular in Egypt. This is not surprising, as these grow abundantly on the Nile Delta. Aish baladi is one of the most common food in Egypt. It's similar to pita bread. Aish baladi is actually a descendant of various kinds of flatbreads that have been baked in Egypt since ancient times. Fittingly, the word “aish” means “life” in Arabic, showing the bread's importance to the lives of the region's people. Another staple of Egyptian cuisine is hummus. The chickpea-based dip is popular throughout the Middle East. While its exact origins are debated, its earliest known mentions are in Egyptian sources. Egyptian hummus is commonly eaten with pita and other food.",Egypt
"It's no surprise that a country of over 7,000 islands and over 100 ethnic groups have such a diverse cuisine. Filipino cuisine has many influences: native, Malay, Indian, Arabic, Chinese, American, Japanese, Korean, and so much more. Each Philippine region has its specialty. Indeed, Filipino cuisine probably deserves a whole listicle of its own! Image from Adobe Stock. Adobo is perhaps the most popular Filipino dish. The term is actually Spanish in origin (it comes from the Spanish word for marinating), but Filipino in preparation. Adobo's main ingredient is vinegar, although most variants also use soy sauce. Pork and chicken are the kinds of meat most commonly turned into adobo, although other ingredients are also possible. Pancit is another popular Filipino dish. Pancit is the Filipino word for noodles and is a product of centuries of Chinese contact and immigration. There are many kinds of pancit in the Philippines, but pancit canton (a kind of wheat noodle) is perhaps the most common. Pancit is a staple in celebrations such as birthdays, parties, and other events. Perhaps the most notorious Filipino dish internationally is balut. Balut are duck eggs that are partially developed. Filipinos and tourists most commonly eat it as street food. Lechon is a whole roasted pig that Filipinos commonly consume at celebrations. Feasts and parties are often not complete without either lechon or pancit. And yes, in case you're wondering: yes, Filipinos love Jollibee. The popular chicken joint with an international cult following is a common sight in cities and developed towns.",Philippines
"German cuisine is one of the most interesting types of cuisine out there. It is perhaps most famous for its sausages and beer. And not without good reason. Both of these foods are staples, and Germans young and old love them. German sausages are among the country's most famous cultural exports. In fact, the beloved Frankfurter takes its name from the city of Frankfurt. But perhaps the most famous German sausage is bratwurst. It's traditionally made with pork, beef, or veal, and seasoned with herbs and spices. Despite being a German creation, it has spread worldwide. In fact, the German diaspora in places such as the United States has even created their takes on it! Sauerkraut is another of Germany‘s most famous dishes. It's a fermented cabbage that Germans add to soups, meals, and even sausages! Many consider it to be Germany's counterpart to Korea's famous kimchi. Other beloved German foods include pretzels, rouladen (a stuffed meat dish cooked with mustard), and sauerbraten (a kind of sour pot roast).",Germany
"Greece's geography and centuries of history are all major influences on Greek cuisine. After all, Greece is next to the Mediterranean, so it's no wonder that both the sea and outside influences have made their mark. The country's cuisine takes large influence from Ottoman cuisine. This is not surprising since the Ottoman Empire ruled Greece for centuries. Gyros are a prime example of this. It's a dish consisting of a flatbread filled with meat and vegetables. It's actually a descendant of the kebab doner and is related to the shawarma. Greek cuisine also makes heavy use of olive oil. This is a result of the abundance of olive trees in the region. Other popular Greek dishes include moussaka, a baked dish made with meat, eggplants, and other vegetables, and dolmades, a stuffed dish.",Greece
"For a country with a history like Israel, it's no surprise that religious dietary laws are a major influence on its cuisine. However, you'll also find influences from its neighbors and other beliefs as well. Many dishes popular throughout the Middle East, such as hummus and falafel, are also popular in Israel. Because dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork and shellfish, meat dishes tend to be made from lamb or fish. Notably, Jews who strictly follow dietary laws actually maintain separate kitchens to separate meat and dairy products. However, such practices are not universal even among Jews. Given that many Israelis have ancestors who came from around the world, many influences have also made their way into Israel too. Examples of beloved Israeli dishes with foreign origins include the pastry jachnun, which was introduced by Yemeni immigrants, and chraime, which originally came from Libya.",Israel
"When one thinks of Jamaican cuisine, Jamaican patties are probably the first (or even only) thing that comes to mind. And while Jamaican patties are popular in Jamaica, the country has much more to offer. Jamaican cuisine is a mish-mash of Caribbean, African, and European flavors. Ackee and saltfish, Jamaica's national dish, is an example of this fusion. Cod is common in Jamaican waters, and it's served with the ackee fruit, which is actually native to Africa. Another popular Jamaican dish is jerk chicken, which uses a slow grill technique along with the use of spices such as thyme and scotch bonnet.",Jamaica
"Kazakh cuisine has some conventional ingredients, but also some more exotic ones. Kazakhstan's meat diet includes mutton among more conventional meats. However, there's also more unusual meat involved: horse meat! Dating back to the Kazakh people's nomadic ancestors, horse meat is central to Kazakh cuisine. Beshbarmak is Kazakhstan's national dish. It involves boiling lamb or horse meat. Other core ingredients include square noodles. Interestingly, the name means “five fingers” in Kazakh.",Kazakhstan
"When one thinks of Asian types of cuisine, Korean cuisine is near the top of the list regarding ubiquity. Kimchi, that polarizing pickled dish with a smell that's loved or hated, is central to Korean dinner tables. Other Korean favorites include bulgogi, a kind of marinated barbecue that uses grilled thin meat slices, samgyeopsal or thin pork belly strips, and gimbap (also spelled kimbap). Gimbap is similar to makizushi but uses cooking instead of raw ingredients, as well as using sesame oil instead of vinegar. One of the more popular types of fusion cuisine in Korea is Korean fried chicken. Korean fried chicken is often double-fried, crispy, and comes in sweet and spicy flavors. In Korea, it is often served with pickled radish and beer.",Korea
"New Zealand's cuisine takes many influences from other types of cuisine. You'll find Māori influences but also nods to English and Australian cuisines too. Even immigrants to New Zealand have made their mark on the country's food. Given that New Zealand is next to the sea, it's no surprise that seafood plays a big role in the country's cuisine. Indeed, the country's official tourism website claims that New Zealand has some of the best seafood in the world. Māori hāngī (or simply hāngī) is one of the most unique aspects of New Zealand cuisine. It's a form of open-pit cooking where meat and other ingredients are heated by hot stones or even geothermal pits. New Zealanders of all kinds usually cook the Māori hāngī way during feasts and other special occasions.",New Zealand
"Like much of Latin America, Peruvian cuisine is a fusion of both indigenous and colonial tastes. Ingredients can either be native to Peru or originate from elsewhere in the former Spanish Empire. Immigrants have also brought in new tastes and ideas. For example, potatoes originated from Peru, so it's no surprise that they're a common ingredient in Peruvian dishes. Quinoa, a kind of grain that's gained popularity worldwide due to its health benefits, is also native to Peru. Many consider ceviche to be Peru's national dish, and not without good reason. This dish, which consists of fish cooked and marinated with citrus juices, is common street food. Another well-known Peruvian delicacy is roast guinea pig, also known as cuy. It's often served on special occasions, and its taste has often been compared to that of duck.",Peru 
"Polish cuisine is a nod to the country's heritage and geography. Meat is a common ingredient in Polish dishes, but noodles and even dumplings are not uncommon too. Many Polish dishes use pork as their main ingredient. Bigos is Poland‘s national dish. It's characterized by the use of Polish sausages and can be mixed with other kinds of meat. Pork is most commonly used, but rabbit meat is a possible option! Kotlet schabowy, also known as simply schabowy, is a fried pork cutlet that's similar to the pork cutlets of neighboring countries. Finally, there's piergogi, a flour-based dumpling that's often made with meat fillings and potatoes.",Poland
"Both local and international factors have made their mark on Spanish cuisine. After all, when you're a historic seafaring country that once ruled much of the world, you're sure to have a lot of offerings. Paella is perhaps the most famous Spanish dish in the world. While a beloved Spanish favorite, it also has a following in countries with and without former Spanish influence. Its main ingredients are olive oil, rice, and saffron. There are many kinds of paella, ranging from meat to seafood. What doesn't change is that Spaniards and others most commonly serve paellas at celebrations and gatherings. Cochinillo asado is a whole roasted suckling pig. It is the progenitor of similar dishes around the world, such as the Philippines' lechon. Other Spanish favorites include churros (long fried dough strips that are a popular street food worldwide), croquetas (Spain's take on the croquette), and gazpacho (a blended tomato and vegetable soup and a summer favorite).
",Spain
"As the descendant of one of the most influential empires in world history, it's not surprising that Turkish cuisine is a melting pot of flavors. After all, Turkey is at the intersection of the East and the West, which makes it a strong breeding ground for much diversity in its offerings. The kebab (also spelled kebap) is perhaps the most famous Turkish food in the world. It's not actually a single dish but rather a way of cooking. Kebab simply refers to grilled meat, and there are many methods to choose from. In fact, some sources claim that there are over 30 variants of kebab! Kebabs can be served on barbecue sticks, or more commonly internationally, in wraps called doners. Doners are similar to shawarmas, but doners are the Turkish variety while shawarmas come from the Arabian Peninsula. Köfte is Turkey's take on the classic meatball. They're usually made from beef (unsurprising since Turkey is a majority Muslim nation) and often served with salad or beans. Anchovies, known locally as hamsi, are also a popular delicacy and are typically served fried. Finally, there's dolma, meat-stuffed inside cabbage or grape leaves that's also popular in Eastern Europe.",Turkey
"Borscht, the red beet soup we've already mentioned earlier in this listicle, is Ukraine's national dish. In fact, despite its popularity in Russia, it is a Ukrainian invention. Similarly, varenyky are a popular form of dumplings that many compare to the European pierogi. Finally, no discussion of Ukrainian cuisine would be complete without chicken Kiev. This traditional dish consisting of breaded chicken stuffed with butter sauce is not only popular in Ukraine but also internationally. In fact, tourism websites claim that many tourists crave it the moment they arrive in the capital Kyiv.",Ukraine
